# Bootstrap

This repo contains some of the most basics code blocks to start off with Bootstrap. 
It starts with Basic Hello World! of Bootstrap and covers some of the topics like adding rows, cols, icons and buttons. It also covers how to manage the size of cols and rows. 
Currently i have not provided any sort of documentation within the code (Really sorry for that.)

Following are some of the great resources that will help you start with Bootstrap.
